## Overview of the Flood Control Projects in the Philippines

**Project Background**

<p align="justify"> The Philippine Flood Control Dashboard was created to analyze data and provide insights into flood control projects across various regions. This project aims to provide an overview of the financial aspects, contractor performance, and the distribution of various flood control projects across the Philippines. </p>

**Findings will be discussed as follows:**
- **Financial Allocation:** Estimated total cost of the projects, approved budget, and surplus of the budget.
- **Budget and Cost Trends:** An analysis of the total cost of projects and the approved budget for each funding year.
- **Contractor Performance:** An analysis of the top 5 performing contractors in terms of projects and cost. This also includes the average of early and delays of project completion.
- **Distribution of Projects:** This shows the total flood control projects in each region, province, and municipality. This also evaluates the percentage of each project type.

Below are the overview of the Power BI dashboard

**Financial Allocation**
- **Estimated Total Cost:** 547,257,436,984.52  billion pesos **(PHP 547.26 bn)**. 
- **Approved Budget:** 562,929,075,405.80 billion pesos **(PHP 562.93 bn)**.
- **Budget Surplus:** 15,671,638,421.28 billion pesos **(PHP 15.67 bn)**.

Overall, this suggests good budget utilization considering the surplus. However, it is worth noting that cost and budgets vary per project, hence some projects incur budget deficiencies.

**Budget and Cost Trends**
- From 2018 to 2025, the estimated total cost each year does not exceed the total approved budget for each year.
- The trends of total cost and budget **increased from 2018 and reached its peak in 2023**, with the highest cost of PHP 203.08bn and budget of PHP 208.74bn.
- However, in **2024 and 2025, it records a significant decline** in the total budget and cost. In 2025, the total budget and cost are PHP 1.46bn and PHP 1.45bn, respectively.
  
**Contractor Performance**
- The graph shows the top five constructors by cost. It shows that **Legacy Construction is the contractor with the highest cost of PHP 8.3bn** followed by **Sunwest Inc.**, with PHP 8.2bn, **QM builders** with PHP 7.0bn, **Alpha and Omega Gen.** with PHP 5.7bn, and **St. Timothy Construction** with PHP 5.5bn.
- It is also shown that these five contractors have the most flood control projects, with **Legacy Construction being at the top with 115 projects**, followed by **QM builders** with 88, **Alpha and Omega Gen.**, with 84, **St. Timothy Construction** with 83, and **Sunwest Inc.** with 67 projects.
- In addition, projects are usually delayed compared to having early completion. It is shown that the **average delay takes up to 59 days**, while the average **early completion only takes 28 days**.

This suggests that the same construction company won most of the bids for most of the projects, and most of them do not follow the contract completion. 

**Distribution of Projects**
- **Region III has the highest projects**, particularly in **Bulacan and Pampanga**.  It is followed by the **National Capital Region (NCR)**, where **Manila and Quezon City** have the highest projects in the NCR.
- The most common flood control projects are **flood mitigation, which occupies 64.46% of the projects**, followed by the construction of revetments and slope protection.

High concentration of projects are in Luzon, suggesting less prioritization of projects in Visayas and Mindanao.

**Recommendations**
- Reallocate surplus budgets to projects with budget deficiencies, provinces with fewer projects, and the least-funded project types.
- Determine the reasons why 2023 had the highest number of projects and why the number of projects declined in the following years.
- Implement strict regulations to ensure that projects are completed early or on time, since the findings show that most of them are delayed.
- Re-evaluate the qualifications of construction companies in terms of cost efficiency and contract timelines to improve overall outcomes, particularly to further reduce costs and enhance project completion rates.
- Assess whether the provinces with the highest number of projects are flood-prone areas to ensure better prioritization of project investments.
